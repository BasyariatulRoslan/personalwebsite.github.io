<p>When I was in high school, I had a poor self-esteem and became bothered by
everything around me. However, as time passes, I realise that even persons with
amazing personalities encounter challenges and exert effort in their everyday lives.
I was able to make friends and learn how people's perspectives varied from one another.
Apart from that, dealing with society is the hardest process, but we will still have to confront in every time.</p>
